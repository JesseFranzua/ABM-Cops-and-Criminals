# Cops and Criminals model based on SugarScape example from Mesa
within the Model folder one finds agents.py where all agent classes are defined. In order to run the model, place the current directory on the Model folder and run the command "mesa runserver". This requires that the mesa package is installed which can be installed via pip.

One also finds the run_no_visual Jupyter notebook where multiple experiments are coded out and sensitivity analyses.

In the sensitivity_analysis_data folder one finds a notebook that reads the sensitivity analysis outputs that were generated and performs the Sobol analysis.
